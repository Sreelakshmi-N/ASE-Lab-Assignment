  <string name="title">Great white Sharks</string>
  <string name="subtitle">Great white sharks live in almost all coastal and offshore waters which have water temperature between 12 and 24 °C (54 and 75 °F)</string>
  <string name="paragraph1">The white shark is principally an epipelagic (living in the upper part of the water column) dweller of neritic (nearshore) waters.

  <string name="paragraph2">The great white is at the top of the food chain and has few threats in the ocean.
      Only orcas and larger sharks can pose a risk. The only other risk to the great white shark is human interaction.
      They are sometimes caught by accident in fishing nets or intentionally sought out by sport fisherman.
      Their jaws and fins are sold for considerable amounts of money.

\n\nNot much is known about the mating habits of great white sharks. What is known is that after mating the
      female develops several eggs which hatch in her womb. The newly-hatched shark pups feed on unfertilized eggs in the
      womb as they develop before being born.

\n\nIn general, the mother gives birth to a litter of two to ten pups, each of which average 1.5 m (5 ft.) in length.
      Male great whites reach maturity at 9-10 years of age. Females mature even later, between 14 and 16 years of age.
      Female sharks are thought to give birth once every couple years, but even that is uncertain.
